# Component - Product List
Here, we will inject our dependency for <code>ProductService</code> in the <code>constructor()</code> into <code>ProductListComponent</code>. We will also setup a Property here for an array of products (using <code>Product[]</code>). Once the Angular component is initialized, we will call the <code>ngOnInit()</code> method which is similar to the <code>PostConstruct</code> which is where we will add the hook to call the <code>listProducts()</code> method. We will manually implement this method where we will call the <code>productService</code> and subscribe to the data. This method will execute asynchronously and when the data is returned, we will assign it to our own property (which is the <code>product[]</code>). This integrates our service with the Angular Component. Now, we will display this data through the HTML File.
