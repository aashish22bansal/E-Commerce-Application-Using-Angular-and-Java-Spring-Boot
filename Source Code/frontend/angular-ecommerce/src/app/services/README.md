<p>Here, we will create the Base URL for the Spring Boot REST API. Then, we will create the Injector in the Constructor using the <code>HttpClient</code>.</p> Further, we will create the <code>getProductList()</code> method which would return an <code>Observable</code> of <code>Product</code> Array. This method is basically going to map the JSON data from the Spring Data REST Service to a <code>Product</code> Array. We will also add a supporting interface <code>GetResponse</code> which would help us unwrap the JSON data from the Spring Data REST API and make use of <code>_embedded</code> entry that comes back from the Spring Data REST API. Here, we will access the <code>products[]</code>.
